# Bombali #
Bombali is a monitoring tool that monitors websites (through HTTP GET), databases, servers (through PING), etc and sends notifications when they go down. Kind of like Nagios.

At Bombali's base its a monitor that sends notifications when events occur. Due to this it can be used for many things and it is quick to extend.
